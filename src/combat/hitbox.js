/**
 * Returns true if attacker can hit defender with the given move.
 * All tolerances are in WORLD UNITS.
 *
 * Facing is a unit vector in the XZ plane (state.facingVec). The reach test is
 * done in that frame: `forward` is the component along facing, `lateral` the
 * component across it. For a belt-scroller the vector is always ±X, and then
 * forward === signed dx and |lateral| === |dz| — i.e. this is exactly the old
 * X-signed test, bit-for-bit. A free-roam game that aims facing on both axes
 * gets a cone that turns with it, for free.
